    <h1 class="h1-text">About Project</h1>
    <p class="p-project">Boarding schools provide students with a unique learning environment that combines academic excellence with personal growth and development.
        These schools offer students the opportunity to live and study in a community of their peers, where they can learn valuable life skills
        such as independence, responsibility, and self-discipline.
        However, managing boarding school students can be a complex task, as it involves a wide range of responsibilities such as overseeing student activities, ensuring student safety and well-being, and managing student behavior.
        This is where boarding school student management comes in.
Boarding school student management refers to the processes and systems used to manage the academic, social, and personal aspects of boarding school students. This includes everything from scheduling classes and managing student grades,
 to coordinating extracurricular activities and providing emotional support to students who may be struggling.
